        <h2>Advanced Risk Management & Psychology üß†</h2>
        <p>This is the final, and most crucial, lesson. Your strategy is useless without proper risk management and a strong mental game. This lesson is about protecting your capital and mastering your emotions.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Risk Management: Protecting Your Capital</h3>
        <p>Move beyond simple stop-loss orders and learn to manage your risk like a professional. The key is to think in terms of percentage, not just price.</p>
        <button id="toggleButton16" class="toggle-btn" aria-expanded="false" data-target="info-16">
          <strong>Show More Content</strong>
        </button>
        <div id="info-16" class="toggle-content">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Position Sizing:</strong> This is the most critical concept. Instead of risking a fixed amount of money, you determine your trade size based on a fixed percentage of your total trading capital (e.g., 1-2%). This ensures that a losing streak doesn't wipe out your account, and as your capital grows, your trade size grows with it.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk-to-Reward Ratio:</strong> This ratio measures the potential profit against the potential loss of a trade. A ratio of 1:2 means you risk $1 to make $2. Always aim for a ratio greater than 1:1. This allows you to be profitable even if you only win half of your trades.</li>
            <li><strong>Portfolio Risk:</strong> Managing risk is not just about a single trade. It's about how much of your total portfolio is exposed to a single sector or asset. Diversify to avoid having a single event, like a crash in a specific industry, from devastating your entire portfolio.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Controlling Your Emotions: The Cause & The Solution</h3>
        <p>Emotional control is what separates successful traders from those who struggle. Learn to identify the psychological pitfalls and how to overcome them.</p>

        <h4>1. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)</h4>
        <button id="toggleButton17" class="toggle-btn" aria-expanded="false" data-target="info-17">
          <strong>Show More Content</strong>
        </button>
        <div id="info-17" class="toggle-content">
          <p><strong>Cause:</strong> You see a stock or crypto suddenly soaring, and you feel a desperate need to jump in, fearing you‚Äôll miss the profits. This often leads to buying at the peak, just before a reversal.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Stick to your trading plan. If the asset doesn't meet your pre-defined entry criteria, do not trade it. Patience is your greatest asset. There will always be another opportunity.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>2. Revenge Trading</h4>
        <button id="toggleButton18" class="toggle-btn" aria-expanded="false" data-target="info-18">
          <strong>Show More Content</strong>
        </button>
        <div id="info-18" class="toggle-content">
          <p><strong>Cause:</strong> After a losing trade, you feel a strong urge to immediately jump into another trade to "win back" your money. This emotional decision-making leads to poor analysis and often bigger losses.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Take a mandatory break after a loss. Step away from the screen, analyze what went wrong with the previous trade, and don't re-enter the market until you are calm and rational.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>3. Overtrading</h4>
        <button id="toggleButton19" class="toggle-btn" aria-expanded="false" data-target="info-19">
          <strong>Show More Content</strong>
        </button>
        <div id="info-19" class="toggle-content">
          <p><strong>Cause:</strong> You feel an addiction to the excitement of trading, constantly seeking action even when there are no valid setups. This leads to taking low-probability trades and racking up commissions and fees.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Set a strict limit on the number of trades you can make per day or week, regardless of how the market is behaving. Quality over quantity is the golden rule.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>4. Fear of Taking a Loss</h4>
        <button id="toggleButton20" class="toggle-btn" aria-expanded="false" data-target="info-20">
          <strong>Show More Content</strong>
        </button>
        <div id="info-20" class="toggle-content">
          <p><strong>Cause:</strong> You refuse to close a losing position, hoping it will turn around. This leads to holding onto a "bag" that continues to decline, turning a small manageable loss into a catastrophic one.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Acknowledge that losses are an unavoidable part of trading. Pre-define your stop-loss and treat it as a sacred rule. Accept that not every trade will be a winner.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>5. Greed & Holding Too Long</h4>
        <button id="toggleButton21" class="toggle-btn" aria-expanded="false" data-target="info-21">
          <strong>Show More Content</strong>
        </button>
        <div id="info-21" class="toggle-content">
          <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Your trade is in profit, but you refuse to close it, hoping for even more gains. This often leads to the price reversing, wiping out all your profits and sometimes even turning into a loss.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use a trailing stop or a pre-defined take-profit target. Once your target is hit, take your profits and walk away. A smaller profit is far better than a big loss.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Ultimate Tool: The Trading Journal</h3>
        <button id="toggleButton22" class="toggle-btn" aria-expanded="false" data-target="info-22">

            <li>The reason you entered and exited the trade.</li>
